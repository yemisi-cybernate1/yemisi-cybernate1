## Introduction
I am a Cybersecurity Analyst at Log(N) Pacific specializing in securing Azure Enterprise infrastructure. My work focuses on bridging the gap between automated threat detection and enterprise-wide vulnerability remediation. I am dedicated to hardening cloud environments and reducing organizational risk through proactive monitoring and rigorous compliance standards.

## Objective
This GitHub serves as a professional portfolio of my work in Vulnerability Management and **Cloud Security Operations. It showcases my ability to deploy enterprise-grade security tools, perform deep-dive log analysis using KQL, and manage the full lifecycle of vulnerability remediation.
